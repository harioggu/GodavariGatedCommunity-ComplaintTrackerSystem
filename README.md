# 🏘️ Gated Community Complaint Tracker

**Problem Statement:**  
Managing complaints in apartment complexes is often inefficient, with complaints getting lost or unresolved due to a lack of proper tracking.  
This system allows residents to log complaints, track their status, and receive updates from the apartment administration team in a streamlined way.
